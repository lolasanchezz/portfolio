        "body": "I was initially inspired by wireshark - an app that, although extremely practical, \
        is very myopic in its presentation of data. While packets can be sorted, it takes extra work to extrapolate patterns about network traffic. \
        While knowing specific packet data could be useful, I wanted to know broader information about the behavior of all the processes on my computer \
        to detect malware, bugs, or abnormal patterns in network traffic. I found myself using nettop right next to wireshark to match packets to processes, \
        which inspired me to make ntwatch - a combination of processes and packets."

    {
      "header": "v0.35",
      "body": "I first started by exploring existing go libraries to read socket data. I wanted to do it as low level and efficient as possible, as I knew \
      I would be examining sockets alongside packets, which would come in extremely quickly and in huge amounts. AKA, no exec calls of lsof. However, existing go-socket libraries for macos \
      were incomplete and buggy. While I might attempt to fix such libraries in the future, at the beginning, I really just wanted to get a working prototype going. Therefore, my \
      first goal was to access socket data through go with c's libproc, a macos provided c library to access proc(ess) data. That's why the first version (aka v0.5), pictured above, is \
      a go program with bubbletea displaying all socket information through cgo. In all, this part was the hardest - it was a lot of research into libproc, a barely used \
      library, and on what socket struct values actually mean, considering macos provides very little documentation. In all, I ended up with a prettier version of \
      nettop/netstat, which was already an accomplishment in and of itself. I ended up submitting v0.5 as a project for Hack Club's Athena Award."

    {
      "header": "v1.0",
      "body": "After ensuring I could access sockets through go in v0.5, I started on progressing towards the full version of ntwatch, which would display packets alongside processes. \
      I decided on the above design, facilitating communication between the packet collection process and the cgo socket reading through bubbletea's cmds. I wanted to keep the \
      two processes completely seperate and have them constantly running asynchronously, in order to recieve packets and sockets as quickly as possible. I came up with a simple \
      matching process to match sockets and packets by just matching those which had the same listening/outgoing ip, process name, and source/destination port. While the GUI still \
      needs work, the core functionality is done."
